# Screenshot For Blocked
A simple Twitter bot for screenshotting tweets from users who blocked you.
The common use-cases are:
1. User A retweeted User B. <br>
Let's assume that for some unknown reason, User B blocked you. <br>
Now you can tag the bot (https://twitter.com/blocked_screen) and it will comment the blocked tweet.
2. User A commented on a tweet by User B. <br>
Again, for some unknown reason, User B blocked you. <br>
Tag the bot as a comment to the comment of User A, and it will comment the blocked comment.

Specail additions:
* Even if User B blocked the bot, it will still be able to get the wanted screenshot.
* If the bot can't comment on a tweet (for example, if the user who tweeted locked the comments) - you will get a DM with the screenshot instead of a comment.
* Add the word "dark" to the mention to get the screenshot in dark-mode. 

When the bot won't be able to do its job?
1. User A blocked the bot.
2. User A or User B are private users.
